1.  The way to declare a variable
2.  Main difference is scoping rules. Variables declared by var keyword are scoped
    to the immediate function body (hence the function scope) while let variables are 
    scoped to the immediate enclosing block denoted by { }
3.  The const keyword does not allow a variable name to be reused anywhere within your code. 
    The let keyword is useable in instances where the variable is going to be reassigned
4.  Var can be used everywhere. Let and const can only be accessed within the block it was declared
